Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:

Clear Structure and Documentation: Waterfall follows a linear, sequential approach with well-defined stages and documentation, providing clarity and structure.

Predictable Outcomes: The methodology allows for more accurate prediction of project timelines, costs, and deliverables.

Ease of Management: The sequential nature of Waterfall makes it easier to manage and track progress, with clear milestones and deadlines.

Less Customer Involvement Needed: Once the requirements are defined, Waterfall requires less continuous customer involvement compared to Agile.

Disadvantages:

Inflexibility to Change: Waterfall is less adaptable to changes in requirements once the project is underway, making it difficult to respond to new information or feedback.

Delayed Feedback: Since the product is only delivered at the end of the project, any issues or misalignment with customer expectations are discovered late in the process.

Potential for Rework: If changes are needed after a phase is completed, it may require significant rework and additional costs.

Longer Delivery Time: The sequential nature of Waterfall can result in longer delivery times, as each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.
